# Subtraction of Integers

Subtraction of integers works by **adding the opposite** of the number being subtracted.

## Rule

To subtract an integer, change the subtraction sign to addition and change the sign of the second number:

a − b = a + (−b)

---

## Example

### Problem:
5 − (−3)

### Step 1: Change subtraction to addition  
Subtracting a negative becomes adding a positive:

5 − (−3) = 5 + 3

### Step 2: Add the numbers  
5 + 3 = 8

---

## Conclusion

Subtracting a negative integer increases the value.  
So, **5 − (−3) = 8**.
